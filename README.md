# Azure AD B2C extension

The Azure AD B2C extension for VS Code lets you quickly navigate through Azure AD B2C [custom policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/active-directory-b2c-overview-custom). Create elements, such as: technical profiles and claim definition. For more information, see [Get started with custom policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/active-directory-b2c-get-started-custom).

## Having an issue?

## Smart Copy & Paste
When you customize an XML element in the extension policy, **Smart Copy** allows you copy the entire element with its parents elements from the base policy. For example, when you copy the AAD-UserWriteUsingAlternativeSecurityId technical profile, smart copy generates an XML containing the following elements, so you don't need to look for the parents element, such as the claim provider. 

```XML
<ClaimsProviders>
  <ClaimsProvider>
    <DisplayName>Azure Active Directory</DisplayName>
    <TechnicalProfiles>
      <TechnicalProfile Id="AAD-UserWriteUsingAlternativeSecurityId">
        ...
      </TechnicalProfile>
    </TechnicalProfiles>
  </ClaimsProvider>
<ClaimsProviders>
```

On contrariety, the **Smart Paste**, pastes from the clipboard only the necessary elements. Given the above XML, and your extension policy already has a claims provider named `Azure Active Directory`, the smart paste will paste only the technical profile without the claims provider. But if there is no such claims provider, the smart paste will paste the entire XML (including the claims provider and the technical profile).

>Note: In this version the samrt copy and paste is limited to a single XML node.

## Application Insights
Collect logs from Azure AD B2C and diagnose problems with your Azure AD B2C vocode extension. Read more [here](https://github.com/yoelhor/aad-b2c-vs-code-extension/blob/master/src/help/app-insights.md). The logs are organized by the **policy name**, **correlation Id** (the application insights presents the first digit of the correlation Id), and the **log timestamp**. This allows you to find the relevant log based on the local timestamp and see the user journey as executed by Azure AD B2C.

## Policy Settings
Allows you to manage the values of your Azure AD B2C environments. When you execute the **B2C Policy build** command, the VS code extension finds and replaces the values of your settings with the ones configure in the policy file, and creates a directory that contains all of your policy files (after the replacement). In the following example, the extension replaces the keys with the value configure in the `appsettings.json` file: 
- {Settings:Tenant}
- {Settings:ProxyIdentityExperienceFrameworkAppId}
- {Settings:FacebookAppId}

![App Settings](media/app-settings.png)

The configuration `appsettings.json` file contains the keys with their values for each environment. 
- **Name** contains the environment name which VS code extension uses to create the environment folder (under the environments parent folder). Use your operation system legal characters only. 
- **Tenant** specifies the tenant name, such as contoso.onmicrosoft.com. In the policy file, use the format of **Settings:Tenant**, for example `{Settings:Tenant}`.
-  **Production**  (boolean) is preserved for future use, indicating whether the environment is a production one. 
- **PolicySettings** contains a collection of key-value pair with your settings. In the policy file, use the format of **Settings:** and the key name, for example `{Settings:FacebookAppId}`.



On the first time, you run the **B2C Policy build** command, the VS code extension lets you create the  `appsettings.json` file, with default set of environments, keys, and values:

```JSON
{
  "Environments": [
  {
    "Name": "Development",
    "Production": false,
    "Tenant": "your-tenant.onmicrosoft.com",
    "PolicySettings" : {
      "IdentityExperienceFrameworkAppId": "Your dev environment AD app Id",
      "ProxyIdentityExperienceFrameworkAppId": "Your AD dev environment Proxy app Id",
      "FacebookAppId": "0"
    }
  },
  {
    "Name": "Test",
    "Production": false,
    "Tenant": "your-tenant.onmicrosoft.com",
    "PolicySettings" : {
      "IdentityExperienceFrameworkAppId": "Your test environment AD app Id",
      "ProxyIdentityExperienceFrameworkAppId": "Your test environment AD Proxy app Id",
      "FacebookAppId": "0"
    }
  },
  {
    "Name": "Production",
    "Production": true,
    "Tenant": "your-tenant.onmicrosoft.com",
    "PolicySettings" : {
      "IdentityExperienceFrameworkAppId": "Your production environment AD app Id",
      "ProxyIdentityExperienceFrameworkAppId": "Your production environment AD Proxy app Id",
      "FacebookAppId": "0"
    }
  }]
}
```
You can add, or remove environments, keys, and values, to accommodate your needs. For example, you can add new settings, such as the URL of a REST API end point, Google+ app Id, URL of content definitions. You can also add new environment, such as pre-prod. Make sure you provide the same set of key (with the relevant values) for each environment. In the following example, we add the **Pre-Production** environment and new set of key-values.

```JSON
{
  "Environments": [
  {
    "Name": "Development",
    ...
  },
  {
    "Name": "Test",
    ...
  },
  {
    "Name": "QA",
    ...
  },
  {
    "Name": "Pre-Production",
  },
  {
    "Name": "Production",
    "Production": true,
    "Tenant": "your-tenant.onmicrosoft.com",
    "PolicySettings" : {
      "IdentityExperienceFrameworkAppId": "Your AD app Id",
      "ProxyIdentityExperienceFrameworkAppId": "Your AD Proxy app Id",
      "FacebookAppId": "0",
      "MicrosoftAppId": "0",
      "GoogleAppId": "0",
      "RESTApiServer": "The location of your REST API",
      "HTMLPagesServer": "The location of your HTML page layout files"
    }
  }]
}
```
After the command is completed, you will find the exported policies under the **Environment** folder. **Important**: Before you upload the policy to your Azure AD B2C tenant, check the values of the exported policy files.
